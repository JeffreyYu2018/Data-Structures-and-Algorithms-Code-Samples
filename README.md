# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Code-Samples
This repository contains samples of code from projects in my Data Structures and Algorithms class, CPSC 223. I've included
two assignments: Merge19 and Spell19. Merge19.c implements an efficient, top-down merge sort using only one stack and queue.
Spell19 uses breadth-first search to create a word ladder connecting an initial word to a goal word using words found in a dictionary. Deque.c simultaneously implements both queues and stacks in C.
