# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Code-Samples
This repository contains samples of code from projects in my Data Structures and Algorithms class, CPSC 223. I've included
two assignments: Merge19 and Spell19.

Merge19.c and Deque.c implement an efficient, top-down merge sort using only one stack and queue. Deque.c is the implementation
of the stacks and queues, while Merge19.c is the main executable.
